Here's a recap of all the tasks you've accomplished in your repository:

- You've created your first GitHub Actions workflow file.
- You learned where to make your workflow file.
- You defined an event trigger, a job, and a step for your workflow.
- You're ready to automate anything you can dream of.

### What's next?

1. Make a new branch named `test-workflow`.
1. Make a change, such as adding an emoji to your README.md file, and commit the change directly to your new branch.
1. In the **Pull requests** tab, create a pull request that will merge `test-workflow` into `main`.
1. Watch the workflow running in the checks section of the pull request.
1. Notice the comment that the workflow adds to the pull request.
1. Wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). Another workflow will run and will replace the contents of this README file with instructions for the next step.
